# pleurodira-biogeo
Repository related to the publication "Phylogeny, biogeography and diversification patterns of side-necked turtles (Testudines: Pleurodira)"
All input files for the biogeography analyses can be found in the folder 'common-input-files'. We used the same script for all ancestral area reconstruction analyses ('ancestral-area-rec' folder) just changing the input files according to the analysis. There are four biogeographic stochastic mapping scripts ('BSM' folder), one for each analysis.
The subtrees for each of the seven time bins used in the diversification analyses, as well as their results, can be found in the folder 'diversification-files'.
The taxon-character matrix used for the phylogenetic analyses is provided as a 'nexus' file named 'Ferreira-et-al-RSOS.nex'.
