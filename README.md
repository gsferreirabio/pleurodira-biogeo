# pleurodira-biogeo
Repository related to the publication "Phylogeny, biogeography and diversification patterns of side-necked turtles (Testudines: Pleurodira)"
All input files canbe found in the folder 'common-input-files'. We used the same script for all ancestral area reconstruction analyses ('ancestral-area-rec' folder) just changing the input files according to the analysis. There are four biogeographic stochastic mapping scripts ('BSM' folder), one for each analysis.
